{% newthought "This project" %} consists of a series of interactive web-based data dashboards for exploring the Covid-19 pandemic according to regional socio-economic and demographic statistics.

<!--more--> This project enables the public to explore how social inequalities don't simply vanish in crisis but can instead be magnified, allows policy makers to see where more resources may be necessary to combat the spread of the virus, and helps researchers with preliminary exploration of trends for their own work. Versions of the dashboard exist for exploring virus statistics at [international](https://mspringsteen.shinyapps.io/counting-covid19/), [US state](https://mspringsteen.shinyapps.io/counting-covid19-USA/), and [US county](https://mspringsteen.shinyapps.io/counting-covid19-counties/) levels.

Features may be added to the dashboards upon request, and data will be updated daily to remain in line with the latest  available information. Built on an open-source framework with R Shiny, all project code is available on GitHub.
