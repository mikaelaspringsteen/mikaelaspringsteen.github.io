Presented at the 2020 Pratchett Project Conference.

{% newthought "Much has been written" %} about the incredible intertextuality and range of Terry Pratchett’s work, including his incorporation of classical literature, popular film, folk stories, music history, and even bawdy humor. Yet much remains to be explored in his works. This paper introduces an area of Pratchett Studies which has, as yet, remained largely unexplored: Pratchett’s treatment of the practice and culture of scientific disciplines. <!--more-->  Throughout his work, especially the Discworld series and associated texts, Pratchett constructs a dichotomy of scientific work. ‘Folk’ science—a term describing science learned and practiced informally—is epitomized by the practice of the witches, living as they do in the ‘real world’, while ‘formal’ science is reserved primarily for the wizards cloistered in the halls of Unseen University. Given the heroic status of the witches, it might therefore appear as though folk science is to be considered good and impactful, while formal science is, at best, entirely ineffectual. Yet ample evidence exists for a more complicated reading. Scientific advancements drive the plot in later novels, and others describe folk science as akin to a stepping stone on the path to formalized study. Other texts invoke formal scientific history and folklore with the same care and respect afforded more traditional folk stories. Science pervades this former science journalist’s work. As such, this paper seeks to introduce the many ways in which this science writing may be studied. How does Pratchett lead us to think about the practice and culture of science? Are certain sciences more beneficial than others? Are scientists to be admired or ignored? How is science ‘done’? And how, if at all, is it that science should be incorporated into daily life?
