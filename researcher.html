<p>What does it mean to study number in social life?</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.7rem">As a social technology, numbers are cultural objects, both in
  particular
  instances and as
  a
  class, and humans
  interact with numbers in ways both social and cultural, not just mathematical or technical. The rise of big data, an
  associated explosion of quantification, and a tendency toward commodification and financialization have rendered the
  cultural impact of numbers more salient than ever.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.7rem">Societies today are faced with numbers of increasing scope, scale, and
  complexity compared
  to those faced by our
  ancient ancestors, and we must find ways of integrating these numerical objects into social life or, whether by
  accident or design, resisting such integration.</p>
