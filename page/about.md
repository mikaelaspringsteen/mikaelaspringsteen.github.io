{% marginfigure "profile-id" "assets/img/profile.jpg" %}{% newthought "Hi, I'm Mikaela Springsteen" %} and I find answers.

I have a very hard time sitting with an unanswered question. Thankfully, through a combination of data science and social research&mdash;along with a healthy dose of the more classical, brute-force kind of research which has taught me that it is actually possible to max out a library card&mdash;I very rarely have to. I've also found that one of the best ways to learn is through talking with people, which I've been lucky enough to do in over ten countries and in three different languages.

With a background in the arts, I also work on a number of more artistic projects, including in cooking, baking, watercolor, photography, and woodworking.

## The Day the Saucers Came
{% marginfigure "saucercake-id" "assets/img/about/saucercake.jpg" %} June 2015

A four tier hummingbird cake decorated exclusively with chocolate. This cake took as its inspiration "The Day the Saucers Came" by Neil Gaiman. It was meant to be 'read' from the top down, in the same way in you would read the original poem.

The cake was filled with cream cheese custard, iced with a browned buttercream frosting, and covered with dark, milk, and white chocolate.

Winner of the Grand Prize at the 2015 BCA Chocolate Competition.
