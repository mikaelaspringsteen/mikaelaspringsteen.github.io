{% newthought "I find answers" %}

As a mixed methods researcher studying quantification and valuation across social life—and a Jr. Research Scientist at the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service—I research the weird and wonderful ways that humans organize their lives.

Current research topics include health insurance coverage, compensatory payments, folk economics, and the intersection of folk science and literature.

{% newthought "I make things" %}

With a background in the arts, I also work on a number of more artistically-minded projects, in media including wood, watercolor, and fiber.
