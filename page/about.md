{% marginfigure "profile-id" "assets/img/profile.jpg" %}{% newthought "Hi, I'm Mikaela Springsteen" %} and I find answers.

I'm a mixed methods social researcher studying quantification and valuation across social life. I have a very hard time sitting with an unanswered question. Thankfully, through a combination of data and social science&mdash;along with a healthy dose of the more classical, brute-force kind of research which has taught me that it is actually possible to max out a library card&mdash;I very rarely have to. I've also found that one of the best ways to learn is through talking with others, which I've been lucky enough to do in over ten countries in three different languages.

{% newthought "Current research projects include:" %} compensatory payments, folk economics, quantification

With a background in the arts, I also work on a number of more artistically-minded projects, including in watercolor, cooking, photography, and woodworking.

## The Day the Saucers Came
{% marginfigure "saucercake-id" "assets/img/about/saucercake.jpg" %} June 2015

A four tier hummingbird cake decorated exclusively with chocolate. This cake took as its inspiration "The Day the Saucers Came" by Neil Gaiman. It was meant to be 'read' from the top down, in the same way in you would read the original poem.

The cake was filled with cream cheese custard, iced with a browned buttercream frosting, and covered with dark, milk, and white chocolate.
