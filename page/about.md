{% newthought "I find answers" %}

As a mixed methods social researcher studying quantification and valuation across social life, I am currently investigating compensatory payments, folk economics, and the intersection of folk science and literature.

With a background in the arts, I also work on a number of more artistically-minded projects in media including wood, watercolor, textile, food, and photography.
