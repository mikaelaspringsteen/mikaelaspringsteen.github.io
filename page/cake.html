<h2>The Day the Saucers Came</h2>
<p>This cake takes as its inspiration another Neil Gaiman piece&mdash;"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBJVGwmswZI">The Day the Saucers Came</a>".{% marginnote "saucer-mn-id" "There is one small addition not drawn from the poem. I completed the cake shortly after the passing of the incomparable Sir Terry Pratchett. As another of my favorite authors, his works shaped much of who I am today and I included a small tribute to him on the top tier. I figured Neil Gaiman wouldn’t mind." %} It is meant to be 'read' from the top down, the same way in which you would read the original poem. The cake topper represents the title and first stanza. The top tier includes the name of the author&mdash;Neil Gaiman&mdash;positioned immediately beneath the 'title', just as it would be in a standard formatting of the printed poem. Each tier includes elements drawn from the corresponding stanza. The cake itself is a twist on the classic Southern hummingbird cake – which was modified to include white chocolate. The layers are filled with a cream cheese custard filling, and covered with a browned buttercream frosting. Each layer is then covered in chocolate.</p>
