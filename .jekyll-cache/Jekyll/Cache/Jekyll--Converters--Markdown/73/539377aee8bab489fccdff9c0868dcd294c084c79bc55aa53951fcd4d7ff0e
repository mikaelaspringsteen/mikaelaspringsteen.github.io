<p><a href="https://mikaelaspringsteen.github.io/countingcovid19/">This project</a> enables the public to explore how social inequalities donâ€™t simply vanish in crisis but can instead be magnified, allows policy makers to see where more resources may be necessary to combat the spread of the virus, and helps researchers with preliminary exploration of trends for their own work. Versions of the dashboard exist for exploring virus statistics at international and US state levels.

<p>Features may be added to the dashboards upon request, and data will be updated daily to remain in line with the latest  available information. Built on an open-source framework with R Shiny, all project code is available on GitHub.</p>
